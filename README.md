30 Day Plank Challenge is a site that offers to perform Planck's 30 Day Challenge.</br>
Plank is an isometric core strength exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push-up for the maximum possible time.
Through the website, you can follow the training program and perform the required training.</br>
The workout is done according to a certain amount of time that the exercise requires, so each activity has a Countdown that tells the trainer how much time remains for the current exercise.
